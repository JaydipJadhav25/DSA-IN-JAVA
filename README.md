## 🧠 What is DSA?

**DSA** stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**:

- **Data Structures**: Techniques to store and organize data efficiently (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs).
- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures to solve problems (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming).

## 🚀 Why Learn DSA?

- 🔍 **Efficient Problem Solving**: Write optimized and scalable code.
- 💼 **Crack Tech Interviews**: Top companies (FAANG, etc.) focus heavily on DSA.
- 🧠 **Improve Logic**: Develop strong analytical and coding skills.
- ⚙️ **Real-world Usage**: Powers search engines, social networks, compilers, and more.
